# Vats - Os level Entity

## Aim
I aim to create a simple animated entity, that can interact with windows and settings of my Linux system.
How should the animation look like? Honestly, it doesn't matter, it can be a simple circle. What we want is power to manage things on screen.

## What would be my first Milestone?
- It should be able to detect edges of windows and collide with them.

## What Do I know about it?
I can create some app like that using python but it will not be able to detect the edges of other windows.
So I might need to work on OS level. I need to know who is responsible to render windows on screen and I can work at that level to get information about rendered windows from there.

# Who gets the work done
Since I have basic meta info about windows which we can get with `hyprctl clients`.
So the next question is which language to use to parse that data and create that animation to detect the edges.

I am comfortable with python. It can easily parse this data and we can create animation as well. So the simplest language for me to use is python.
But should I?

## What do I need?
I need to know what I need before I choose a language. Although it seems very tough for me to know what I want technically but I definitely need control.
So for now we are depending entirely on `hyprctl`. We don't get whatever it doesn't offer.
For now I don't need much, and I need to detect window edges. That's all and this much can be simply achieved with `python`

But I am getting so many doubts now

## Doubts

- Which language is most suitable to work for animation?
- Can I write animation part in one language but control simple things with python and use rust later when I need more power. Can I use different langauges in same project? If yes, then how?
